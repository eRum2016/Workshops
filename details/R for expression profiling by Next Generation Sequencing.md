## R for expression profiling by Next Generation Sequencing - Paweł Łabaj (Austrian Academy of Science / Boku University Vienna) 
 
**Description of proposed workshop**

The main goal of the workshop will be to show how R can be helpful in data analysis in life sciences. In particular, I will demonstrate how R can be used for gene/transcript expression profiling in RNA-Seq (Next Generation Sequencing of mRNA) experiments.
 
**Plan of the workshop**

- Short introduction to Bioinformatics and overview of Next Generation Sequencing
- Short introduction to Bioconductor (provides tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data)
- Presentation of selected packages for expression profiling
- Presentation of selected packages for differential expression analysis
- Comparison of selected approaches by discussion over the analysis results
- Take home messages and concluding remarks
 
**Required packages**

Please install the packages 'Rbowtie','limma','edgeR'. These required packages are available through Bioconductor. Beside these packages please install 'locfit' package from CRAN.
 
**Required skills of participants**

Basic R programming skills. Biological background would be a plus.
 
**Required work to do before workshop**

Bioconductor, TBD
 
**Research experience**

I was one of the leading authors in set of publications from the MAQC-III/SEQC consortium. I have couple years of experience in data analysis from high throughput experiments.
I am a fellow of Austrian Programme for Advanced Research and Technology of Austrian Academy of Science. Previously I was a post-doc fellow at Boku University Vienna. Still affiliated there.
 
**Experience as lecturer/teacher**

couple years of teaching/lecturing at Boku University Vienna and abroad
