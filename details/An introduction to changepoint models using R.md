## An introduction to changepoint models using R - Rebecca Killick (Lancaster University, UK)
 
**Description of proposed workshop**

More data is being collected in the world today than ever before resulting in larger and longer data sets. With the length of data sets increasing, the statistical properties of the data are likely to change over time. Traditional statistical methods often make the assumption that the statistical properties do not change over time and thus can lead to incorrect conclusions when changes occur.  A common method for relaxing this assumption is to segment the data into smaller periods within which the statistical properties do not change. One advantage of this technique is that the traditional (stationary) methods can be utilized on the individual segments. The points in time when the statistical properties change are referred to as changepoints.

This course introduces participants to the analysis of changepoint models (also known as time series segmentation or structural changes). The course is aimed at those with an interest in discovering methods for models that include changepoints. It is interactive and uses packages available on CRAN.

Techniques covered in this course include: likelihood and nonparametric methods for detecting changes in mean, regression and variance. Each topic is explained theoretically and there will be break outs where participants will use the techniques on real data sets from a variety of application areas including finance, genomics and environment.

Following the course participants will be able to:
* recognize datasets that potentially contain changepoints
* identify appropriate changepoint methods dependent on the type of change suspected
* perform changepoint analyses using a variety of techniques in R
* summarize and evaluate results of a changepoint analysis
* check assumptions made within a changepoint analysis
 
**Plan of the workshop**
* What is changepoint analysis?
* Types of changepoints
* Methods for detecting changepoints (bulk of course)
- Nonparametric
- Likelihood
* Checking assumptions
* Summarizing results of a changepoint analysis
 
**Required packages**

* changepoint (and dependencies)
 
**Required skills of participants**

* Basic knowledge of R; reading in data, working with vectors and functions. 
* Basic knowledge of likelihood and hypothesis testing / model choice would be useful.
 
**Required work to do before workshop**

* Bring you own laptop to work on
* Install a recent R version
* Install the changepoint R package and dependencies. 
* Bring any questions about your own data.
 
**Research experience**

Early career researcher, 4 years post-PhD. My research is in developing methodology for the analysis of nonstationary time series to address real world problems.
 
**Experience as lecturer/teacher**

Lecturer in Statistics, has taught a range of courses over the last 10 years from first year undergraduate introductory courses to PhD level courses including theoretical and practical courses. This course has been delivered to companies who are interested in using the package with positive feedback specifically related to its focus on applicability.
